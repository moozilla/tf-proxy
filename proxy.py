"""Create a network proxy to sniff Tetris Friends network traffic.

This script establishes a simple TCP network proxy between the Tetris Friends server and
client, that can be used to sniff traffic, as well as inject traffic. Possible uses:
* Record games as they are being played, to create a large corpus of game play data
  (eg. for training a ML model)
* Generate live stats on player performance, and inject chat message summaries
* Experiment with undocumented parts of the game

Based on LiveOverflow's code here:
https://github.com/LiveOverflow/PwnAdventure3/tree/master/tools/proxy

For this to work you will need to route "sfs.tetrisfriends.com" to localhost in your
/etc/hosts file.
